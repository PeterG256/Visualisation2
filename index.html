        <p>
          A volcanic eruption is a natural disaster where materials such as rocks and particles, called tephra, are expelled out from a volcano.
          An eruption by itself is enough to kill directly, though after a powerful enough eruption, the surrounding air and ground may become toxic, causing crops to fail and breathing to be difficult among other things.
          <br>          
          The <b>V</b>olcanic <b>E</b>xplosivity <b>I</b>ndex (<b>VEI</b>) is measure of how potent an eruption is.
          It is a logarithmic scale from 0 (where no tephra are released from the volcano) to 8 (where 1,000,000,000,000 m³ of tephra are released).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Where and have the most fatal volcanic eruptions been, and what kind of volcano erupted?
        </h2>
        <div id="volcano2" class="chart"></div>
        <p>
          Evidentally, the areas with the most fatal volcanic activity are Indonesia, Phillipines, Japan, and Central America.
          There have been eruptions with a VEI of 8, but none since humanity started recording history.
          <!-- <br> -->
          Most volcanic eruptions are from <b>stratovolcanos</b>, which are the quintessential example of volcanoes (a single conical mountain covered by many layers of tephra with an opening at the top).
          <!-- <br> -->
          The tallest volcano to have caused a death is <b>Cotopaxi</b> at 5,911 m.
          For comparison, the tallest mountain in the world Mount Everest is 8,848 m tall.

        <h2>
          What are the eruptions with the most deaths?
        </h2>
        <div id="deadliest" class="chart"></div>
        <p id="bar_chart_note" class="note">
          The deadliest eruption was <b>Tambora</b> in Indonesia with a VEI of 7.
          It was so powerful that its tephra spread wide enough to lower the temperature globally, causing 1816 to be what is known as <i>The Year Without Summer</i>.
          There have been no other documented VEI 7 eruptions.

        <h2>
          By which agents do eruptions cause the most deaths?
        </h2>
        <div id="death_types" class="chart"></div>
        <p id="bar_chart_note" class="note">
          Of all ways to die from a volcanic eruption, <strong>pyroclastic flows</strong> are the biggest killer.
          They are a mix of volcanic matter travelling close to the ground that can reach temperatures of 1000°C and speeds of 100 km/h.
